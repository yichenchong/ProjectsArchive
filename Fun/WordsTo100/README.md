# WordsTo100

The other day, I saw a post.

If we assigned the letters A,B,C,D,... to the numbers 1,2,3,4,... respectively,
K+N+O+W+L+E+D+G+E = 96
H+A+R+D+W+O+R+K = 98
but only
A+T+T+I+T+U+D+E = 100

Well, that would be inspiring if there were no other words that add up to 100.
So I wrote a script.

Enjoy.






Side note:
Ellipsis is also 100 ... ... ... ...
