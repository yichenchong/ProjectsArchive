# Almanac
The Almanac was a project to index our school students in a database, by harvesting data from our Schoology Learning Management System.

almanacTest was an initial proof-of-concept, in which my friend built a rudimentary crawler to index some information, and I built a Python program to build me a HTML table-style database for us to access, but we found that that approach 1. harvested too little information 2. was very slow

almanacGather features a data mining tool designed by me to gather student information, as well as several scripts to sort and store that information, including as an offline SQLite database.
