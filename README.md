# ProjectsArchive

An archive of some of my past projects.

"Fun" consists of some scripts I wrote, tongue-in-cheek, to generally have fun while writing code.

"Classwork" chiefly consists of work I had to complete for AP Computer Science A, and features a few Java packages of code.

"Libraries" consists of different reusable engines and packages I've written to help me perform different computational tasks (e.g. physical simulation, computational Geometry, cellular automation)

"Projects" consists of a few long-term projects that I did

"WebDevelopment" consists of a few front-end web designs that I've done
